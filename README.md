# Automated-mail

Hello guys!!!
This is a repo where you will find the Python code for automating e-mail sending via a spreadsheet.
This code uses smtplib and pandas libraries of python which you can install by using the following commands.

pandas : pip install pandas

smtplib : pip install python-smtplib

Instead of smtplib you can also use secure smtplib which can be installed by the command : pip install secure-smtplib

Pandas is used to read the spreadsheet or the csv file to get mail ids of the people we want to send the mail and smtplib creates a channel
for us to send the mails.

Hope this repo helps you out.
